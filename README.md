# UFOs

# Overview
Build a dynamic table with HTML and Javascript that filters through data on multiple crtieria. 

# Results

Are we alone? Let's use our table of UFO sightings to find out more about these sightings of UFOs.

You can see there is a search bar for each of the first 5 columns to our table of data containg UFO sightings. 
We can filter by one criteria or multiple and the table will return any results matching that one/ or many criteria.

Here is our table once we've filtered it down to a specific "date", "state", and "shape" recorded.

# Summary

One drawback from this current design is the lack of a "Clear Filters" button. So you have to manually delete all filters to get back to our original table. 

Two recommendations for improvement would be to allow fulling spelling of States' names to filter the states you want as well as including the "Clear Filters" button.
